# How to contribute

We want you to be able to help make better devices for healthcare and lab environments, making it as easy as possible to contribute changes.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to get started in contributing to Openpump. If you have found a bug, or have a suggestion, you can submit an issue on GitHub:

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.

If you'd like to contribute directly to the code, schematics or designs:

* Fork the repository on GitHub. If you haven't used GitHub before, the desktop client for [Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [Windows]
(https://windows.github.com/) makes it a bit easier.
* Submit a pull request with your new contribution.
