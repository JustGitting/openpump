# Openpump: Firmware

## Setup

To get this up and running in your Arduino environment, you need two libraries:
- [Encoder](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html)
- [Gameduino2]

Install it in the Arduino environment using the [official instructions](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

## Working with Gameduino 2
If you want to create your own assets for Gameduino 2, follow the setup instructions below and also see the instruction on the [Gameduino 2 website](http://excamera.com/sphinx/gameduino2/code.html#gd2code). 

### Library setup
Prerequisites:
- Install PIL using `sudo pip install pil` 
- Install Gameduino 2 asset converter and Python libraries using `sudo pip install gameduino2`

Note: On Mac you can also install `sudo pip install pillow` and port Gameduino 2 to use Pillow instead of PIL: http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/porting-pil-to-pillow.html
